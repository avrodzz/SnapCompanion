# Snap Companion
Final Project of Snap Academies 2022. 

Snap companions is a personalized hub for directing Snapchatters to mental health resources both on and off the app through a personal and customizable
companion. The user will be able to directly contact various crisis lines, Here For You, Headspace, and our nonprofit partner, Active Minds. With snap
companions we aim to provide accessibility to mental health resources and provide an outlet to the youth.
